## What, Why & Where PePpermill?
**What -** PePpermill is an open-source framework to automate browser based applications using selenium API.
The thought process behind this is to setup a quick test project and jump on to write code for automating test cases.

**Why -** A Go-ready framework with all basic needs to start automating browser based test applications. What that means is one does not have to spend time on cooking, just get it on the way! :)

**Where -** PePpermill is an API, add library as depencency under project. (Use IDE's like IntelliJ or Eclipse)
